# Looplift

Looplift is a CLI tool that "lifts" files from within a filesystem, directly onto the block device hosting the filesystem.  This can be used to facilitate filesystem conversions.

# Example usage

_Maybe coming soon._  For now, check the `integration_test.py` script which exercises end-to-end.
